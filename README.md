# React Social Media App

Rendering data is one of the most important aspects of programming. Without data, what will the user see? A big, empty space! 

This social media app is simple by design. All I wanted to do = fetch a user's information from GitHub and use that info to create a minimal (but attractive) profile. 

Coolest part? You can type any GitHub username in the search box to view a different profile. It's incredible how React can pull in new information without a long and inconvenient loading process.

## How the App Works

- Scroll down the page and notice the profile consists of a name, username, bio, location, and follower list.
- Randomly pick another user from the follower list, copy/paste into the search box, and observe how the state changed.
- Feel free to change the screen size and analyze the mobile responses built into the CSS rules for a positive user experience.
